### Bachelor Thesis in 2016

- Using SpringMVC + Mybaits + MySQL + Maven. 

  - The code is completed in 20 days. So it can be run, but there are still a lot of **data and code redundancy** inside, and **the scalability of the framework** has not been considered, at the same times **database optimization（include DML, SQL, Structure）** is still the biggest problem. 

- [ ] Refactor + update
- [ ] \(Optional) Rewrite

###  Abstract

>The attendance always is an important reference data for school supervision the students' study.The present domestic university still limited to the artificial attendance, statistics, bulletin notice patterns as the way of check courses attendance,This mode takes up more time in class, and also the waste of resources,And many of the data are not easy to save, most of that are one-time data,teacher also does not have the corresponding archive, on subsequent it have an greatly impact for the teacher to student's evaluation.

>Teacher through the campus course attendance sign-in platform release their courses, and students register their classes by logging in mobile phone platform.

>Then the teacher attendance, students through the mobile phone platform to sign-in the related courses. The background according to the corresponding data and algorithm to determine whether a student to class, to complete all relater data statistics, collect and input. The development of this platform based on Spring MVC framework, and using Mybaits for data management, front ends use BootStraps and JQuery, JQueryMoblie implementation, all the writing and debugging code by the development tool Eclipse(luna) to finish.

>Through the corresponding debugging to the platform, it’s easy to found that the course attendance sing-in platform can effectively link teachers, curriculum, students, and the associated data of the corresponding attendance and sign in can also be good.

>On the platform, the related data about the teachers and students of the current semester can be storage, even generate an form to download.

>During the current semester, teachers and students can be directly on the platform to view all the relevant data information about this semester.

>Through the campus course attendance sign-in platform can realize the function of currently, debugging results show, this platform is largely saved the time of the artificial sign in, improve the efficiency of the check-in process, improve the accuracy of the data, and prefect the storage way of data。

>**Keywords：attendance sign-in for Spring MVC, network platform, mobile check-in**
